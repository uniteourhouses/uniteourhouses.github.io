							<h2 style="font-family:middleearthmedium;">An Unexpected Journey</h2>
							<p>Ben and Amber met online in June 2014 just as it was becoming the norm for many. They set their first date across town at a local Irish restaurant. Ben had an unusually great day at work and even left early so he'd have plenty of time to show up early. However, on his way home his car broke down. Amber had a normal day of classes at University and was surprised to get a text from Ben saying that he was having his car towed to the mechanic and would be late. Thinking Ben was trying to get out of the date, she suggested that they postpone, but Ben insisted that he'd be able to make it. Ben decided to bicycle across town on that hot humid day and arrived for dinner late, sweaty, and off his "game".</p>

<p>Amber and Ben officially started dating on the 4th of July and then one month later Ben took Amber to Chicago for their first weekend date on a "choose your own adventure" itinerary he had planned out. Included was a front row seat at <a href="https://www.medievaltimes.com/">Medieval Times</a>, which was the original motivation for the trip. The next day Amber chose the <a href="https://www.carnivalechicago.com/">Carnivalé</a> dinner restaurant where they tried an amazing appetizer of seared octopus that set them on an ongoing culinary quest for delicious foods.</p>

<p>No matter where life took them over the next few years, Ben and Amber always made a point to go back to Chicago and visit Medieval Times each year. Amber graduated and Ben went back to school. After Ben finally graduated the two moved to Virginia in 2019 for a new adventure. After the move, Amber thought it was the end of their yearly trip. Ben had other plans and suggested they go to Chicago and Medieval Times as usual.</p>
 
<p>Ben planned a "greatest hits" tour of Chicago and decided he would propose at the Carnivalé restaurant in downtown Chicago on Friday night, but like the first date nothing went according to his plan. On Friday morning Amber and Ben boarded an early flight from Baltimore to a layover in North Carolina. After the connecting flight was rescheduled because the "plane was missing a part" Ben began to panic inside a little bit. After boarding the second flight, which eventually turned around and returned to the gate after taxing for takeoff, Ben began to panic inside a lot. Ben ran off to call the restaurant who thankfully had a "do anything for this customer" note on his reservation to tell them they would be late and then shaved, changed his clothes, and brushed his teeth in the airport bathroom. Amber also had to change her outfit in the airport bathroom while Ben snuck the ring into his pocket.</p>
 
<p>When the plane finally landed eight hours late, the city was deadlocked in traffic due to two major accidents in rush hour. After fighting traffic Ben and Amber finally made it late to their rescheduled reservation. The couple was greeted by the manager who happily wished Amber a Happy Birthday (it wasn't her birthday), which confused the couple and panicked Ben even more since he thought they confused his plans with another reservation.</p>
 
<p>Ben had arranged for the staff to bring out the same dish of octopus they had tried years earlier. The plan was to give the manager his camera to record the proposal under the guise of taking a photo together. After seeing the plate of octopus Amber suggested taking a photo, so Ben decided to go for it. He handed the wait staff his camera and got down on one knee, sweaty and off his "game" and then all he could think to say was: "I love you." After some prodding, he remembered to actually ask the question and of course Amber said yes.</p>

							<h2 style="font-family:middleearthmedium;">We Eloped!</h2>
							<p>Not wanting to wait any longer, Ben and Amber decided to get married on their own. While they both wished their friends and family could have joined, their elopement ceremony offered a unique experience. In early October 2020, Amber and Ben rented a secluded cabin on a lake just outside of Shenandoah National Park. The night before the ceremony Ben and Amber each wrote their vows in a pair of handmade journals while enjoying the heat of a wood stove. Very early in the morning Ben cooked a bacon and egg breakfast from a cast iron skillet.</p>

							<h2 style="font-family:middleearthmedium;">A New Family</h2>
							<p>Ben and Amber got dressed and left to meet the photographer and officiant at the trail head of Blackrock Summit in the heart of Shenandoah National Park. The half hour drive through the park was made even more special by a heavy fog that blanketed the forest from the light rain the night before. After lighting two lanterns, the couple hiked a mile to the summit just in time for sunrise. Together, they read their vows to one another on the first day of their new lives together, both looking forward to their future role as parents.</p>
